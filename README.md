Climate Crisis Predictor
This is a simple web application that allows users to select a future date and receive a hypothetical probability of a climate crisis occurring on that date, along with three AI-generated potential scenarios.

Please Note: This application is for illustrative and educational purposes only. The probability calculation is a simplified, hypothetical model and does not reflect actual scientific climate predictions or models. The scenarios are generated by an AI and are fictional. *** IT IS FICTIONAL! ***

Features
Date Selection: Easily pick any future date using a date input field.

Hypothetical Probability Calculation: A simple algorithm calculates a simulated percentage likelihood of a climate crisis based on the chosen date.

AI-Generated Scenarios: Utilizes the Gemini API to generate three distinct and plausible (though fictional) scenarios of what could happen on the specified date due to climate change impacts.

Responsive Design: Built with Tailwind CSS for a clean and responsive user interface that adapts to different screen sizes.

How It Works
Probability Calculation
The application uses a basic JavaScript function (calculateClimateCrisisProbability) to determine the hypothetical probability. This function:

Sets a base probability of 50% for the current date.

Calculates the difference in years between the current date and the selected future date.

Increases the probability by 3% for each year into the future.

Caps the final probability between 0% and 100%.

It's important to reiterate that this is a simplified, non-scientific calculation.

AI Integration (Scenario Generation)
The core of the scenario generation relies on the Gemini API.

When you click "Calculate Crisis Risk," the calculated hypothetical probability and the selected date are sent as a prompt to the Gemini API.

The Gemini model then processes this prompt and generates three distinct textual examples of potential climate crisis scenarios relevant to the given date and probability.

These scenarios are returned as a JSON array and displayed in the application.

Setup and Usage
Getting Started
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/climate-crisis-predictor.git
cd climate-crisis-predictor

Open index.html: Simply open the index.html file in your preferred web browser. No local server is required.

Gemini API Key (For Local Development)
If you are running this application outside of a Google Canvas environment (like directly from your local machine), you will need to obtain your own Gemini API key and insert it into the code.

Go to Google AI Studio and generate an API key.

Open index.html in a text editor.

Locate the line const apiKey = ""; within the <script> tags.

Replace "" with your actual Gemini API key:

const apiKey = "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"; // Replace with your actual key

Important: For security, never commit your actual API key directly to a public GitHub repository. For production applications, use environment variables or a secure backend to manage API keys. For this simple front-end demo, direct insertion is shown for ease of use.

How to Use
Select a Date: Use the date picker to choose a future date.

Click "Calculate Crisis Risk": The application will then display the hypothetical probability and the AI-generated scenarios.

View Results: The probability percentage and the three potential scenarios will appear below the input section.

Technologies Used
HTML5: For the basic structure of the web page.

Tailwind CSS: For rapid and responsive styling.

JavaScript (ES6+): For all application logic, including date handling, probability calculation, and API interaction.

Gemini API: For generating the climate crisis scenarios.

Disclaimer
This project is a demonstration of web development and AI integration. The climate crisis predictions and scenarios are hypothetical and simulated. They are not based on real-world scientific data, complex climate models, or expert forecasts. Always refer to reputable scientific sources for accurate information on climate change.
